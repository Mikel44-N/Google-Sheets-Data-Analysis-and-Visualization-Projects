# Google-Sheets-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Projects
This is a hands-on Google Sheets project covering spreadsheet fundamentals, formulas and functions, pivot tables, and data visualization.
The work simulates real-world business scenarios and demonstrates how Google Sheets can be used to organize data, perform analysis, and communicate insights through interactive dashboards and charts.

Spreadsheet Fundamentals (HR Data Management)
Business Scenario
Role: HR Administrator at ACME Corporation
Dataset includes employee job titles, departments, salaries, performance scores, and satisfaction data.

Objective
Organize and structure HR data to improve readability, data entry accuracy, and employee monitoring.
